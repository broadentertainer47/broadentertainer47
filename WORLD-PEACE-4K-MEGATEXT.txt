UPDATE #2 (7/18/22): I am entirely reworking the way I would create WP4K lol. Instead of editing, upscaling graphics, editing, upscaling to 4k final product, I
decided to change things up. Instead of the current method, I will cut out all gfx and upscale all live-action footage first. THEN I will run the gfx through
individually, experimenting until I get the best and most faithful output. Another update due to this change: Episodes 1-3 might see a release in early August
(I'm thinking the 5th since it would make it WP's 6th Birthday). A trailer will drop soon confirming this. As for the soundtrack video, I've been having trouble
uploading it (since it is 4 HOURS LONG!). I will try my hardest to get this sorted out as fast as possible. The soundtrack video not only includes 4 hours of music
(including some more obscure tracks which will be listed below in the MUSIC section), but also includes visuals to represent each track. Stay tuned and PLEASE promote
this shit. I want the community to be well aware of this project and not just r/bombstrap. ANYWHERE that has some sort of connection to MDE, whether it be the cumtown
forums, MDE/LSP discord, MondoMegabits discord, youtube, whatever. Peace.

Note: Originally this was supposed to be on pastebin. "SMART Filters" have deemed it "questionable" so I literally cannot post it publicly or unlisted.
fuck you pastebin.
                        
World Peace 4K is a fan project attempting to present the now cancelled [adult swim] tv show "Million Dollar Extreme Presents: WORLD PEACE" in the highest quality
possible. This is because the only available versions of the show are a 1080p censored release from [as] on streaming services and a 720p "uncut & uncensored"
version that has been floating around various websites like reddit and piratebay. Although some would settle for the 720p cut, it is far inferior due to its
choppy framerate and low resolution/detail with graphics (comparison: https://files.catbox.moe/twaee5.png). Not only that, but the "uncut" version features other
errors and issues besides the few I have already mentioned. Annoyed by these issues, and after seeing the high-quality uncensored rips from imgur
(https://imgur.com/a/UuScb), I decided to carry on the WP4K project by myself through ai upscaling graphics and world peace footage (since the previous project leads
have abandoned it countless times). 

You may be wondering why I'm posting here. That's because the spam filter on r/bombstrap keeps taking down my updates. I think whenever there will be an update,
I'll edit this public paste with the information. So if you're interested: KEEP THIS PAGE BOOKMARKED. 

PROGRESS AND ROADMAP:

Episode #01: COMPLETE
Fixed pretty much everything, simply awaiting release.

Episode #02: COMPLETE
Awaiting August 5th release date.

Episode #03: COMPLETE
Awaiting August 5th release date.

Episode #04: ON HOLD
I've STILL been having trouble with the graphics on this one for a while now. If you look at the comparison picture I posted prior, you can see clearly that it says
"MDE PRESENTS" on the top of the opening graphic. Getting this to look clear without disrupting the scanlines/pixels/noise is a hassle to say the least. It is ON HOLD
as of July 4th, 2022.

Episode #05: NOT STARTED
Episode 5 has not been started.

Episode #06: NOT STARTED
Episode 6 has not been started.

PROGRESS: INCOMPLETE
There are still many tracks I have yet to identify/add. Some tracks I couldn't identify don't even appear on the list. These will be available for
download in standard 320kbps MP3 format, but will also feature a FLAC counterpart with significantly better quality. If you know of any that I'm missing,
PLEASE DM me on reddit. My user is r/broad_entertainer_47. I will respond as soon as possible.

Previous Updates:

UPDATE #1 (7/4/22) - Entirely reworked episode 1. Fixed issues with the audio quality (it is now in 5.1 instead of 2.1 stereo), fixed shortened tattoo graphic,
and fixed an audio error with the Cop Killer performance. Episode 2 is complete and I'm now working on episode 3. Should be out within the next few months. Keep in
mind this is a ONE MAN project. I have reached out to people who worked on WORLD PEACE (including Sam, Ruse, and an editor for Pomp&Clout) and have gotten nothing. No
uncompressed graphics are anything (probably protected under a contract or something). The date of release might change but expect late August. Don't be disapointed 
cuz you're getting 3 EPISODES AND THE (still kinda incomplete but not my fault really) SOUNDTRACK. Keep it bookmarked, it's still alive and well don't worry.
Stay Tuned Shooters :)
