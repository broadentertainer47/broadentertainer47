fuck you pastebin.
                        
World Peace 4K is a fan project attempting to present the now cancelled [adult swim] tv show "Million Dollar Extreme Presents: WORLD PEACE" in the highest quality
possible. This is because the only available versions of the show are a 1080p censored release from [as] on streaming services and a 720p "uncut & uncensored"
version that has been floating around various websites like reddit and piratebay. Although some would settle for the 720p cut, it is far inferior due to its
choppy framerate and low resolution/detail with graphics (comparison: https://files.catbox.moe/twaee5.png). Not only that, but the "uncut" version features other
errors and issues besides the few I have already mentioned. Annoyed by these issues, and after seeing the high-quality uncensored rips from imgur
(https://imgur.com/a/UuScb), I decided to carry on the WP4K project by myself through ai upscaling graphics and world peace footage (since the previous project leads
have abandoned it countless times). 

You may be wondering why I'm posting here. That's because the spam filter on r/bombstrap keeps taking down my updates. I think whenever there will be an update,
I'll edit this public paste with the information. So if you're interested: KEEP THIS PAGE BOOKMARKED. 

PROGRESS AND ROADMAP:

Episode #01: INCOMPLETE
What I have uploaded for episode 1 right now is an incomplete version of what I want it to be. There were issues upscaling some graphics, and the audio quality is
pretty bad. I've been trying to improve episode 1's graphics (specifically the intro) for months now and haven't gotten far. Hopefully I can get my hands on some
better rips instead of the 1080p version of [OMITTED]. However aside from this, everything that is featured in episode 1 is final at the moment. As of right now I
am going back and re-editing the audio for better quality.

Episode #02: EDITING/UPSCALING
Episode 2's graphics are very detailed, albeit very stylistically similar to each other. If you look at the imgur, you can see each and every individual pattern
within the graphic. Whether it be scanlines or stylistic pixels, the upscaling software does not respect this and I have had a very hard time trying to get these
graphics to look nice.

Episode #03: EDITING/UPSCALING
Episode 3's graphics are almost done. It's just a matter of perfecting them to the point of where I am happy with the result. This is not the priority at the moment
and will be released either with e2 or e4.

Episode #04: GRAPHICS
I've been having trouble with the graphics on this one for a while now. If you look at the comparison picture I posted prior, you can see clearly that it says
"MDE PRESENTS" on the top of the opening graphic. Getting this to look clear without disrupting the scanlines/pixels/noise is a hassle to say the least. 

Episode #05: NOT STARTED
Episode 5 has not been started.

Episode #06: NOT STARTED
Episode 6 has not been started.

PROGRESS: INCOMPLETE
There are still many tracks I have yet to identify/add. Some tracks I couldn't identify don't even appear on the list. These will be available for
download in standard 320kbps MP3 format, but will also feature a FLAC counterpart with significantly better quality. If you know of any that I'm missing,
