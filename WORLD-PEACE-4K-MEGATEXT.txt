UPDATE #1 (7/4/22) - Entirely reworked episode 1. Fixed issues with the audio quality (it is now in 5.1 instead of 2.1 stereo), fixed shortened tattoo graphic,
and fixed an audio error with the Cop Killer performance. Episode 2 is complete and I'm now working on episode 3. Should be out within the next few months. Keep in
mind this is a ONE MAN project. I have reached out to people who worked on WORLD PEACE (including Sam, Ruse, and an editor for Pomp&Clout) and have gotten nothing. No
uncompressed graphics are anything (probably protected under a contract or something). The date of release might change but expect late August. Don't be disapointed 
cuz you're getting 3 EPISODES AND THE (still kinda incomplete but not my fault really) SOUNDTRACK. Keep it bookmarked, it's still alive and well don't worry.
Stay Tuned Shooters :)

fuck you pastebin.
                        
World Peace 4K is a fan project attempting to present the now cancelled [adult swim] tv show "Million Dollar Extreme Presents: WORLD PEACE" in the highest quality
possible. This is because the only available versions of the show are a 1080p censored release from [as] on streaming services and a 720p "uncut & uncensored"
version that has been floating around various websites like reddit and piratebay. Although some would settle for the 720p cut, it is far inferior due to its
choppy framerate and low resolution/detail with graphics (comparison: https://files.catbox.moe/twaee5.png). Not only that, but the "uncut" version features other
errors and issues besides the few I have already mentioned. Annoyed by these issues, and after seeing the high-quality uncensored rips from imgur
(https://imgur.com/a/UuScb), I decided to carry on the WP4K project by myself through ai upscaling graphics and world peace footage (since the previous project leads
have abandoned it countless times). 

You may be wondering why I'm posting here. That's because the spam filter on r/bombstrap keeps taking down my updates. I think whenever there will be an update,
I'll edit this public paste with the information. So if you're interested: KEEP THIS PAGE BOOKMARKED. 

PROGRESS AND ROADMAP:

Episode #01: COMPLETE
Fixed pretty much everything, simply awaited release.

Episode #02: NEAR COMPLETION/UPSCALING
Episode 2's graphics are very detailed, albeit very stylistically similar to each other. If you look at the imgur, you can see each and every individual pattern
within the graphic. Whether it be scanlines or stylistic pixels, the upscaling software does not respect this and I've STILL been having a very hard time trying to get these graphics to look nice.

Episode #03: FINISHING UP EDITING
Episode 3's graphics are done for the most part. It's just a matter of perfecting them to the point of where I am happy with the result.

Episode #04: ON HOLD
I've STILL been having trouble with the graphics on this one for a while now. If you look at the comparison picture I posted prior, you can see clearly that it says
"MDE PRESENTS" on the top of the opening graphic. Getting this to look clear without disrupting the scanlines/pixels/noise is a hassle to say the least. It is ON HOLD
as of July 4th, 2022.

Episode #05: NOT STARTED
Episode 5 has not been started.

Episode #06: NOT STARTED
Episode 6 has not been started.

There are still many tracks I have yet to identify/add. Some tracks I couldn't identify don't even appear on the list. These will be available for
download in standard 320kbps MP3 format, but will also feature a FLAC counterpart with significantly better quality. If you know of any that I'm missing,
