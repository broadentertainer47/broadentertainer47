UPDATE 7 (1/4/23): [adult swim]'s copyright on MDE has expired, meaning I can post the WP4K episodes without them getting taken down on YouTube.
This also means I'll be switching from Poast.TV to YouTube. All of the WP4K episodes will be found on the YouTube Channel
(https://www.youtube.com/@worldpeace4k/) along with a new soundtrack video and more additional content.
(I’m also working on my own show that’s inspired by MDE. Will update on this when we have something to show for it. Peace.)

fuck you pastebin.
                        
World Peace 4K is a fan project attempting to present the now cancelled [adult swim] tv show "Million Dollar Extreme Presents: WORLD PEACE" in the highest quality
possible. This is because the only available versions of the show are a 1080p censored release from [as] on streaming services and a 720p "uncut & uncensored"
version that has been floating around various websites like reddit and piratebay. Although some would settle for the 720p cut, it is far inferior due to its
choppy framerate and low resolution/detail with graphics (comparison: https://files.catbox.moe/twaee5.png). Not only that, but the "uncut" version features other
errors and issues besides the few I have already mentioned. Annoyed by these issues, and after seeing the high-quality uncensored rips from imgur
(https://imgur.com/a/UuScb), I decided to carry on the WP4K project by myself through ai upscaling graphics and world peace footage (since the previous project leads
have abandoned it countless times). 

You may be wondering why I'm posting here. That's because the spam filter on r/bombstrap keeps taking down my updates. I think whenever there will be an update,
I'll edit this public paste with the information. So if you're interested: KEEP THIS PAGE BOOKMARKED.

PROGRESS: INCOMPLETE
There are still many tracks I have yet to identify/add. Some tracks I couldn't identify don't even appear on the list. These will be available for
download in standard 320kbps MP3 format, but will also feature a FLAC counterpart with significantly better quality. If you know of any that I'm missing,
PLEASE DM me on reddit. My user is r/broad_entertainer_47. I will respond as soon as possible.

Previous Updates:

UPDATE #1 (7/4/22): Entirely reworked episode 1. Fixed issues with the audio quality (it is now in 5.1 instead of 2.1 stereo), fixed shortened tattoo graphic,
and fixed an audio error with the Cop Killer performance. Episode 2 is complete and I'm now working on episode 3. Should be out within the next few months. Keep in
mind this is a ONE MAN project. I have reached out to people who worked on WORLD PEACE (including Sam, Ruse, and an editor for Pomp&Clout) and have gotten nothing. No
uncompressed graphics are anything (probably protected under a contract or something). The date of release might change but expect late August. Don't be disapointed 
cuz you're getting 3 EPISODES AND THE (still kinda incomplete but not my fault really) SOUNDTRACK. Keep it bookmarked, it's still alive and well don't worry.
Stay Tuned Shooters :)

UPDATE #2 (7/18/22): I am entirely reworking the way I would create WP4K lol. Instead of editing, upscaling graphics, editing, upscaling to 4k final product, I
decided to change things up. Instead of the current method, I will cut out all gfx and upscale all live-action footage first. THEN I will run the gfx through
individually, experimenting until I get the best and most faithful output. Another update due to this change: Episodes 1-3 might see a release in early August
(I'm thinking the 5th since it would make it WP's 6th Birthday). A trailer will drop soon confirming this. As for the soundtrack video, I've been having trouble
uploading it (since it is 4 HOURS LONG!). I will try my hardest to get this sorted out as fast as possible. The soundtrack video not only includes 4 hours of music
(including some more obscure tracks which will be listed below in the MUSIC section), but also includes visuals to represent each track. Stay tuned and PLEASE promote
this shit. I want the community to be well aware of this project and not just r/bombstrap. ANYWHERE that has some sort of connection to MDE, whether it be the cumtown
forums, MDE/LSP discord, MondoMegabits discord, youtube, whatever. Peace.

UPDATE #3 (8/14/22): Finally, "Phase 1" of the WP4k Project has been completed. Yeah, this project is in "phases." Phase 1 was episodes 1-3, Phase 2 is
episodes 4-6, and Phase 3 is all additional content. With Phase 1 out of the way and me back home from my week-long vacation, Phase 2 is starting.
I've been fixing 1-3 as much as I can, and trying to combat every single critique so that it's perfect. I want this to become the definitive way to
watch WORLD PEACE. Oh btw, Phase 2 is schedueled for September 16th (the original airdate of WP's finale, 6 years ago). OK bye.

UPDATE 4 (9/16/22): It's pretty much all finished. FINALLY. And it looks good as shit too. Probably the highest quality I've seen. The only problem is file bloat.
I want to upload it but MEGA has a 20GB limit, and WP4K as it stands is 50GB. Finding a way to compress the files without loss of quality, because I KNOW that it's
just file bloat. Regardless, Season 1's overall quality is unbelievable. The recognition I am recieving for this project is great too, as YouTuber EbenFell
just repped the project and would advertise to his followers once complete. Amazing. Phase 3 is next. Be ready. If you guys sense a pattern, I've been releasing
WP4K on key dates for the series. 1-3 were released on the 6 year anniversary of the debut, while 4-6 were released when the series finale aired 6 years ago. So,
just to keep with tradition, the rest of the shit ("Phase 3") will be out on DECEMBER 5th 2022. 

UPDATE 5 (10/17/22): It's been out for a month now. [OMITTED 4K] is up on the channel. Cancelled the music videos cuz it's gonna eat up the time that I could be using
on the actually good extras. Working as fast as I can to fix everything wrong with the episodes currently, while also creating extras. December 5th is the release
date as of now, but things might change depending on my personal life or whatnot. Working on a torrent too for all who hate DDL or streaming for whatever reason.
Some of extras that are (hopefully) going to be out by December are the Lock Cut (found here: https://vimeo.com/303405535), Sci-Fi/Sapien 2016
(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k1jF231RHmc) and the "Hidden Cuts" (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JN3vNoY1go4), which will all be upscaled and remastered to 4K.
Specifically for the Hidden Cuts and Sci-Fi pilot will I be adding some extra things to make it flow like an actual episode of the show. Touching up rough editing and
colors will be done to those two works specifically, along with adding fanmade or unused graphics in between sketches (the fanmade graphics look actually legit don't
worry haha I've got a few good ones selected), and some more stuff. Hope you all enjoy, and if you don't: COME KILL US.



(jk I'll have a standard "pure" cut for the scifi and hidden cuts that are just upscaled to 4K and nothing else. Peace.)

UPDATE 6 (12/6/22): New stuff has been delayed until further notice. Personal issues take priority, but I can assure you this will be worth the wait.
